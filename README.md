### Creating Your First Theme

#### Step 1: Choose Your Style

Decide on your theme's vibe:
- Dark, Light, or AMOLED
- Color palette (warm, cool, neon, pastel, etc.)

#### Step 2: Design Your Color Palette

Pick colors that work well together:

**For Dark Themes:**
- Background: `#0a0a0a` to `#1a1a1a` (deep grays/blacks)
- Text: `#e5e5e5` to `#ffffff` (light grays/white)
- Accent: Any vibrant color that pops

**For Light Themes:**
- Background: `#fafafa` to `#ffffff` (near white)
- Text: `#171717` to `#262626` (dark grays)
- Accent: Any color that provides good contrast

**For AMOLED Themes:**
- Background: `#000000` (pure black)
- Text: `#ffffff` (pure white)
- Accent: High-contrast colors

#### Step 3: Create the JSON File

1. Create a new file named `my-theme.json`
2. Use the template above as a starting point
3. Customize the colors, fonts, and effects to match your vision
4. Test your theme in AnymeX
